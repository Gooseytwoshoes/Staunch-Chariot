# Staunch-Chariot

App that has been my dream to make since I started to learn coding in 2020, made and coded in python on an app pydroid3 on a potato phone that I want to revive in some language more efficient and more functional or by crossing languages in order to achieve my goal to make an app that could help people on tracking expenses and budgeting their hardly-earned money inspired by the book "The Richest Man in Babylon" by George S. Classon.
